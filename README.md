MHS Links
========

A collection of links (and more) for Melbourne High School. Currently contains various links to useful websites, as well as a collection of staff Edumail email links.

MHS Links is generated using Jekyll from data provided in `_data/`. GitHub automatically builds the site, so updating the data files automatically updates the website.


Contributing
========

Anyone can feel free to contribute to MHS Links, whether it be the addition of new links or new emails. **Note that the emails are automatically sorted**, so there is no need to manually sort it in the CSV.

For most people, the easiest way is to privately message me over a medium such as Facebook. If you know the ropes of `git` and GitHub, please send a pull request or make an issue.
